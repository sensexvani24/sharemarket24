## üè≠ Sectoral Performance Analysis

The sectoral performance is expected to show a broad-based rally following the ceasefire announcement, with oil-sensitive sectors leading the charge. **Oil Marketing Companies** are positioned to benefit significantly from the dramatic collapse in crude oil prices, with Brent falling over 5% to $67.45 per barrel following the peace agreement.

**Banking sector** is showing strong pre-market momentum, with both private and PSU banks expected to outperform as lower oil prices reduce inflation concerns and support monetary easing expectations. The financial services sector benefits from improved economic outlook and reduced uncertainty.

**Information Technology** sector is likely to gain from improved global sentiment and potential dollar strength. Major IT services companies are positioned to capitalize on renewed risk appetite in international markets.

**Defence stocks** face headwinds as India's Defence Stocks decline up to 7% amid Israel-Iran truce, reflecting the unwinding of war premium that had supported these stocks during the conflict period.

### Top Performing Sectors Expected:
- **Oil Marketing Companies:** Direct beneficiaries of falling crude prices
- **Banking & Financial Services:** Lower inflation expectations support rate cut hopes
- **Aviation:** Reduced jet fuel costs boost airline profitability
- **Consumer Discretionary:** Lower input costs and improved sentiment

## üåç Global Market Impact

International markets are showing positive momentum following the ceasefire news. U.S. equity futures ticked up in late Asia hours as investors welcomed the de-escalation of Middle East tensions. The relief rally in crude oil markets, with prices falling over $3, has boosted investor sentiment globally.

Asian markets rose Monday as investors assessed the escalating Israel-Iran tensions, and today's ceasefire news is expected to further strengthen positive momentum across regional bourses. The dramatic reduction in geopolitical risk premium provides a favorable backdrop for emerging market assets.

European markets are expected to open significantly higher, with energy-sensitive sectors likely to lead the gains. The removal of supply disruption concerns from the crucial Strait of Hormuz has provided substantial relief to global commodity markets.

## üìà Technical Analysis and Market Outlook

From a technical perspective, the Nifty 50's strong pre-market performance positions it to test the crucial resistance zone around 25,150-25,200 levels. The index closed at 25,112.40 in the previous session, registering a 1.59% gain over the week, and today's gap-up opening could trigger further momentum.

### Key Technical Levels:

**Nifty 50:**
- **Support:** 25,000 (immediate), 24,850 (crucial), 24,700 (major)
- **Resistance:** 25,150 (immediate), 25,300-25,500 (target zone)

**Bank Nifty:**
- **Support:** 56,000 (immediate), 55,800 (strong)
- **Resistance:** 56,500 (immediate), 57,000-57,500 (extended target)

The relative strength index (RSI) for both indices remains in bullish territory without showing overbought conditions, suggesting potential for sustained upside momentum. The market breadth is expected to be strongly positive with advancing stocks significantly outnumbering declining ones.

## üéØ Stocks to Watch

Several individual stocks and sectors present compelling opportunities based on the changed geopolitical landscape. **HDB Financial Services IPO** opens today for subscription at a price band of ‚Çπ700-740 per share, providing retail investors with a fresh investment opportunity in the NBFC space.

**Oil marketing companies** including BPCL, HPCL, and IOC are positioned for significant outperformance as falling crude prices directly improve their refining margins and reduce working capital requirements.

**Private sector banks** such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are likely to lead the banking sector rally, benefiting from improved economic outlook and potential monetary policy support.

**Aviation stocks** including IndiGo and SpiceJet could see substantial gains as lower jet fuel costs directly impact their operational profitability and route expansion plans.

Mid-cap and small-cap segments are expected to show strong performance, with quality names across pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals, and consumer goods attracting renewed institutional interest.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Factors to Monitor

Despite the positive sentiment following the ceasefire, several risk factors warrant careful monitoring. The **fragility of the ceasefire** remains a key concern, with both Iran and Israel having pledged to respond to any resumption of hostilities.

**Currency volatility** could impact sectors differently, with the Rupee posting its strongest opening in over a month on ceasefire hopes, rising 64 paise to ‚Çπ86.11 against the dollar.

**Oil price volatility** while currently beneficial for India, sustained low prices could signal broader global demand concerns that might impact export-oriented sectors.

**Global fund flows** dynamics require monitoring as improved sentiment toward developed markets following risk reduction could potentially impact emerging market allocations.

## üíº Bottom Line

**The Indian stock market's strong response to the Israel-Iran ceasefire demonstrates the market's sensitivity to geopolitical developments and its ability to capitalize on risk reduction.** With Sensex Nifty today showing robust pre-market gains and Bank Nifty advancing strongly, the market outlook appears constructive for sustained momentum.

The dramatic fall in crude oil prices provides a significant structural tailwind for the oil-importing Indian economy, potentially reducing inflationary pressures and supporting corporate margins across sectors. Investors should focus on oil-sensitive sectors while remaining cautious about defence stocks that may face headwinds from reduced war premium.

As the market opens with positive momentum, monitoring the sustainability of the ceasefire and global sentiment will be crucial for determining whether this relief rally can translate into sustained gains across broader market segments.
